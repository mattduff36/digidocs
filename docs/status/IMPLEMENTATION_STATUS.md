## 🚀 Deployment Readiness

### Ready for Development Testing
- ✅ Can run locally
- ✅ Can connect to Supabase
- ✅ Can authenticate users
- ✅ Can create timesheets
- ⚠️ Limited functionality

### Not Yet Ready for Production
- ❌ Missing critical features (inspections, signatures)
- ❌ No error handling in many places
- ❌ No comprehensive testing
- ❌ Missing PWA icons
- ❌ No production environment variables

## 💡 Development Tips

### To Continue Development:

1. **Run the app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Check for errors**: Open browser console
3. **Test timesheet creation**: Create a timesheet and check Supabase
4. **Next priority**: Implement view/edit timesheet page
5. **Then**: Build vehicle inspection form

### Common Issues:

- **"User not found"**: Create profile in Supabase manually
- **RLS errors**: Check policies in Supabase
- **Build errors**: Run `npm install` and check TypeScript errors
- **Supabase connection**: Verify .env.local variables
